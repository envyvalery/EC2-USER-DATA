When you create a new EC2 instance, paste this script into the User Data section (under Advanced details).  Read more here.

This will install a web server and create a simple HTML page that displays “Hello World!” and the host name of the EC2 instance.  This script will run the first time (and only) this server boots up.


#!/bin/bash
# User data for new EC2 instances
# install httpd (Linux 2 version)
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World!  This is $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
