# EC2-USER-DATA
When you create a new EC2 instance, paste this script into the User Data section (under Advanced details).  Read more here.  This will install a web server and create a simple HTML page that displays “Hello World!” and the host name of the EC2 instance.  This script will run the first time (and only) this server boots up.
